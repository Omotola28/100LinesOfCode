#### Description

This simple javascript application is a demonstration of a practical way to use objects in javascript.

Each file in this application is less than #100LinesOfCode :) 

#### Implementation

I used ES6 classes to create a class for the book I would like to submit with the form and another class to handle changes in the UI. 

The book class takes in the parameters title, author, and isbn. 

The ui class handles events like 

addBookToList()
clearInput()
showAlert()
deleteBook()

### How to run

If you download the source code to your IDE, and open it up with VSCode, if you have liveserver installed, left click on the index.html file and it would ask you to open the file in the browser.
